                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and
                        the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform‚Äôs
                        APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
                        <em>bundles
                            of reusable, nestable code.</em> You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                        first,
                        let‚Äôs cover
                        how components work in React Native.

                    <p class="paragraph">React Native runs on <u>React,</u> a popular open source library for building
                        user
                        interfaces with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can get
                        you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><b>+ components.</b>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                        examples:
                        friendly,
                        approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                        elements
                        inside JavaScript like so:
                        <span class="text">&ltText&gt Hello, I am your cat!&lt/Text&gt.</span>
                    </p>
                    <p class="paragraph">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn
                        even
                        more. Because JSX is
                        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span
                            class="text">name</span> for
                        the cat, name, and
                        embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="text">&ltText&gt</span></p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù. </p>
                    <p class="paragraph"><b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                        how
                        components render,
                        state is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
                        changes over
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                    </div>
                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <em>onChangeText</em>
                        prop
                        that takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>
                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language.
                        In this new language,
                        every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
                        translated as
                        "üçï üçï".</p>
